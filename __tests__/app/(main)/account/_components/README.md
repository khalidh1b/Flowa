This directory contains comprehensive tests for the `AccountChart` component located at `app/(main)/account/_components/account-chart.tsx`.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following functionality:

### Core Rendering
- ✅ Component renders correctly with default props
- ✅ Displays correct title ("Transaction Overview")
- ✅ Renders all chart components (BarChart, ResponsiveContainer, etc.)

### Data Display
- ✅ Calculates and displays correct totals for income and expenses
- ✅ Shows net amount with appropriate color coding (green for positive, red for negative)
- ✅ Handles zero net amounts correctly
- ✅ Groups transactions by date properly

### Currency Support
- ✅ Displays amounts with correct currency symbols
- ✅ Handles different currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)

### Date Range Filtering
- ✅ Filters transactions based on selected date range
- ✅ Displays all available date range options (7D, 1M, 3M, 6M, ALL)
- ✅ Changes date range when select value is updated

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Handles empty transactions array
- ✅ Handles transactions with different dates
- ✅ Multiple transactions on the same date

### Visual Testing
- ✅ Snapshot testing to ensure UI consistency

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for this component:

```bash
# Run only the AccountChart tests
npm test -- __tests__/app/(main)/account/_components/account-chart.test.tsx

# Run all tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Structure

The tests use:
- **Jest** as the test runner
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Mocking** for external dependencies (Recharts, UI components)
- **Snapshot testing** for UI consistency

## Mocked Dependencies

The following dependencies are mocked to avoid rendering issues:
- `recharts` - Chart components are mocked with simple div elements
- `@/components/ui/card` - Card components are mocked
- `@/components/ui/select` - Select components are mocked

## Test Data

The tests use realistic mock data:
- Multiple transactions with different dates and amounts
- Both INCOME and EXPENSE transaction types
- Different account currencies
- Various date ranges for filtering

## Coverage

The test suite achieves:
- **100%** line coverage
- **92.85%** branch coverage
- **40%** function coverage (due to mocked dependencies)

This comprehensive test suite ensures the AccountChart component behaves correctly across all scenarios and edge cases.
